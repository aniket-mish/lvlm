## Constrastive Learning

The goal of contrastive representation learning is to learn such an embedding space in which similar sample pairs stay close to each other while dissimilar ones are far apart.

Look at the blog post to learn more about contrastive loss by lilian weng [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive/)
